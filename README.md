A simplistic retro PONG game written to explore [Android 2D](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html) drawing.

The game is not quite finished yet, there is some work that I'm planning to do:

- Adaptive AI (difficulty levels)
- Better, more fluid animation (replace Canvas drawing with OpenGL maybe ?)

Here is a screenshot taken from game running on Android Emulator:
